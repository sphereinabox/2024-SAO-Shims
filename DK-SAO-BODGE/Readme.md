# SAO-BODGE Shim

This SAO (SuperCon Add-On) shim goes between your badge and v1 of DigiKey SAO to swap the pin order and break out the pins for programming the SAMD11.

This was inspired by the DigiKey SAO which was built with the wrong connector on the SAO so pins were flipped, but also used the SAO pins as MCU programming pins.
